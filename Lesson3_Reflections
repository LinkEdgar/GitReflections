To create a new repository one must first create a respo on github and then set it up on git via a remote. On git one must create a repo 
or have a repo they wish to push to gihub. Once you have that you must create a remote with the command git remote add "name of remote" 
'link to the repostitory from github' Afterwards you must push the changes via git push 'remote name' 'branch'
